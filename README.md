     History
</h2>

**CarFigures (The CF Project)** was born out of frustration with the BallsDex team's decisions. Initially, I had no particular liking for the idea; it was more about a response to dissatisfaction. The BallsDex team wasn't keen on implementing the features many of us wanted. I knew that merely complaining wouldn't lead to any change, as hundreds of others had already done so to no avail.

Determined to make a difference, I decided to take matters into my own hands. By forking BallsDex and applying my own changes and preferences, CarFigures came into existence.

CarFigures aims to address the community's frustrations and provide an alternative base to use and build their bots on. It's a project driven by a desire for improvement and a commitment to providing a better user experience.

     Installation
</h2>

### Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Git: Used for cloning the project and updating your bot to the latest versions. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Docker Desktop: Provides an easy way to run your bot in isolated containers. [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Discord Bot Instance: Required to create and manage your bot on Discord. [Create a Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

> **Note:** If you are using Linux as your main desktop (like me) or hosting the bot on a Linux server, it is generally better to use [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).

### Installing
Now since all this is done, let's start!

clone the project using git, preferrably also cloning into a new folder with the name of ur bot, like:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thecfproject/CarFigures showerdex
```

> **Note:** The config.toml isn't updated by default when updating the bot files, you are required to check if any changes happened to the toml file by yourself, it's your responsibility.

     Configuration
</h2>

CarFigures is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the bot's behavior and appearance to your liking!

This is part of CF's philosophy to make customizing your instance as easy as possible.
For now, it's not much, but I'm planning for more soon! :3

now, time to start making that file,
So in ur Bot files, create a new file called config.toml
Read the comments I left in there to help you out!

Here’s a brief overview of the main configuration sections:

- **[settings]**: General bot settings, such as the bot token and command prefix.
- **[team]**: Configuration for bot team like superusers and owners.
- **[appearance.interface]**: Customizable namings in the bot interface.
- **[appearance.commands.names]**: Names of individual commands.
- **[appearance.commands.descs]**: Descriptions of individual commands.
- **[information]**: Information about the project like social links and contributors.
- **[prometheus]**: Settings for Prometheus metrics collection.

     Booting
</h2>
After configuring and editing the config.toml file, it's time to start the bot instance and play with it!

Start by getting docker desktop up and running, then open your file explorer and head to the bot files. ![demo3](assets/demos/demo3.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>For Windows Users</strong></summary>

To access the command prompt pointed to this bot folder, go to the navigation bar and edit it (you can do that by click the empty part once) to type `cmd` or `powershell` then press enter, this will open a new command prompt instance that is pointed to the bot place:
![demo1](assets/demos/demo1.png)
![demo2](assets/demos/demo2.png)

After opening the terminal or command prompt, its time for you to build the project image (the image the contains your database which stores all your bot's progress, the code and more) using `docker compose build`.

Start by getting the Docker desktop up and running, then open your file explorer and head to the bot files. ![demo4](assets/demos/demo3.png)

And now, it is time to start up your bot!\
Using `docker compose up` will make the docker start all the containers and functions, creating connections to the discord's APIs, and allowing the bot to be alive!
And after doing it, the final results should be like this, with the end line saying "(your bot name) is now operational!"
![demo4](assets/demos/demo4.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For macOS/Linux Users</strong></summary>

You should just cd to the place, open a terminal and cd to the folder, if your bot folder is in the documents folder, usually you do `cd ~/Documents/(your bot folder name)`.

### Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

To make sure your PR can be checked out and merged smoothly, please follow these guidelines:

- Clearly describe the purpose of the PR and the changes made. This will make it easy for me to judge the PR. Usually, I don't refuse them, but more clarity = faster response.
- Provide tests and documentation for any new features or changes in functionality. This is good practice to always debug your code before pushing it.
- Include screenshots showing before/after states of any visual changes if possible. This can make it easier for me to review stuff, but I like reading changes too, so no worries about this section.
- Ensure that all existing tests pass without failure.
- Make sure your code follows the project's coding standards and style because code that doesn't correlate with the project's style makes it weird for me to review, and I end up formatting it to look like the rest of the codebase, so please save me some time.
- Go with the least amount of line changes and commits as possible, this will be easier to track and validate, which allows me to review it fast and give small comments if necessary.

### Help and Feedback

If you need help, have questions, or want to share your thoughts, don't hesitate to open an issue or ask about it in the dev category inside the CarFigures Discord server.\
I'm here to support you every step of the way.

     Roadmap
</h2>

I'm excited about the future of the project and all the bots that use it! \
Here are some features and improvements I have planned:

### Future Plans

- Switch from fastapi_admin to our own tech-stack.
- Implementing QoL features for extension developers.
- Combine some existing commands into one (e.g., /user privacy and /user donation policy into /user settings)
